Edit black and white photos in Adobe Lightroom: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\n\nStart from scratch, or download practice files [https://adobe.ly/2NPBIrc] for a head start. Steps below.\n\n1. Open the photo provided (File \u2013 Add Photos), or try these steps with your own.\n2. Click the Edit icon in the upper right.\n3. Apply a preset: Click Presets from the bottom of the Edit panel. Open the B&W preset category, mouse over different presets to preview their effect, and choose the one you like. We chose \u201cB&W High Contrast\u201d.\n4. Edit the default preset settings: Adjust edit sliders to refine the effect. We reduced the Exposure and increased the Clarity.\n5. Apply selective edits: Choose the Radial Gradient, drag to create an oval over the model\u2019s face, and check Invert so edits affect the area outside of the oval. Then adjust the appropriate sliders. We reduced the Exposure and Highlights to focus attention on the model\u2019s face and darken the outlying areas. \n\nTip: The Radial Gradient sliders retain their positions from your last edit. To reset them, right-click one of the adjustment labels (e.g., Exposure) and choose Reset All sliders. Drag the handles to resize the oval. Hover just outside one of the handles and drag to rotate. Click the blue pin to make additional edits.\n\n6. Erase selective edits: With the Radial Gradient still selected, choose the Eraser and brush over areas of the photo where you want to create an effect (such as how we created the appearance of light on some of the plants), or to remove unwanted adjustments.\n\nThat's it!\n\nTo learn, more visit our Lightroom Tutorials page: https://adobe.ly/2NPjB4v\n\nSubscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud: https://www.youtube.com/AdobeCreativeCloud?sub_confirmation=1\n\nDownload Adobe Express: https://adobe.ly/3rDM7M8\n\nLearn More: https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/explore.html?sdid=H822XMCW&mv=social&mv2=ownsoc-org\n\nAbout Adobe Creative Cloud:\nAdobe Creative Cloud gives you the world's best creative apps so you can turn your brightest ideas into your greatest work across your desktop and mobile devices.\n\nConnect with Adobe Creative Cloud:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/creativecloud\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/adobe-creative-cloud/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/adobecreativecloud\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/adobecreativecloud/\n\n#AdobeLightroom\n\nHow to Make Black and White Photos in Lightroom | Adobe Creative Cloud\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYtZ2zsdE_s5MuJKHEcYO0", "channelTitle": "Adobe Creative Cloud", "channelId": "UCL0iAkpqV5YaIVG7xkDtS4Q", "tags": ["learn", "teach", "tutorial", "tips", "tips and tricks", "edit", "how to", "create", "Adobe Creative Cloud", "Creative Cloud", "Adobe CC", "Adobe Cloud", "Adobe creative suite", "#MakeAdobeCC", "#AdobeCC", "#ACCTags", "make it now", "make it cc", "#makeitcc", "split toning", "tone photography", "black and white", "make a photo b&w", "edit black and white images", "make a photo black and white", "edit black and white photos", "monochrome photography", "lightroom", "adobe lightroom"], "viewCount": 71749, "likeCount": 561, "commentCount": 12, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"], "sector": "Technology"}, "fFedbIjsM20": {"annots": ["Unclear"], "publishedAt": "2015-07-29T13:00:01Z", "title": "Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp | Spotlight on Drama [HD] | Netflix", "description": "Join us July 31 for Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, a limited 8-episode series coming to Netflix.

It works between cycles to stay clean and smell good.\n\nThe places you touch most on this dishwasher are all treated with Microban Antimicrobial Technology: the outside handle, buttons, inside handles, silverware organizer and drain cover.

There are two bed lengths, short (five feet) and long (six feet). Power comes from either a 2.7L four-cylinder engine or, until 2016, a 4.0L V6. (The third-generation Tacoma saw this six-cylinder replaced by a 3.5L V6.)\n\nIf you plan on towing or need serious off-road abilities, you\u2019d do well to consider a used Tundra. It's a big, sturdy truck with a powerful engine and good ground clearance. Gas mileage suffers slightly in comparison with the Tacoma, but perhaps not as much as might be expected.

Directed by Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) from a screenplay by William Wheeler (The Hoax) based on the book by Tim Crothers, Queen of Katwe is produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher (The Darjeeling Limited) and John Carls (Where the Wild Things Are) with Will Weiske and Troy Buder serving as executive producers. The film stars Golden Globe\u00ae nominee David Oyelowo (Selma), Oscar\u00ae winner and Tony Award\u00ae nominee Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) and newcomer Madina Nalwanga.\n\nFor 10-year-old Phiona Mutesi (Nalwanga) and her family, life in the impoverished slum of Katwe in Kampala, Uganda, is a constant struggle. Her mother, Harriet (Nyong'o), is fiercely determined to take care of her family and works tirelessly selling vegetables in the market to make sure her children are fed and have a roof over their heads. When Phiona meets Robert Katende (Oyelowo), a soccer player turned missionary who teaches local children chess, she is captivated. Chess requires a good deal of concentration, strategic thinking and risk taking, all skills which are applicable in everyday life, and Katende hopes to empower youth with the game. Phiona is impressed by the intelligence and wit the game requires and immediately shows potential. Recognizing Phiona's natural aptitude for chess and the fighting spirit she's inherited from her mother, Katende begins to mentor her, but Harriet is reluctant to provide any encouragement, not wanting to see her daughter disappointed. As Phiona begins to succeed in local chess competitions, Katende teaches her to read and write in order to pursue schooling. She quickly advances through the ranks in tournaments, but breaks away from her family to focus on her own life. Her mother eventually realizes that Phiona has a chance to excel and teams up with Katende to help her fulfill her extraordinary potential, escape a life of poverty and save her family. Disney's Queen of Katwe will open in U.S. theaters on September 23, 2016.\n\nLike Queen of Katwe on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/QueenOfKatwe/\n\nFollow Queen of Katwe on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/queenofkatwe\n\nFollow Queen of Katwe on Instagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/queenofkatwemovie", "channelTitle": "Walt Disney Studios", "channelId": "UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ", "tags": ["Queen of Katwe", "Disney", "Chess", "David Oyelowo", "Lupita Nyong'o", "Madina Nalwanga", "ESPN", "Mira Nair"], "viewCount": 83407, "likeCount": 156, "commentCount": 15, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"], "sector": "Media"}, "1l3gM4VH1ec": {"annots": ["Authority"], "publishedAt": "2015-03-13T15:00:01Z", "title": "Orange is the New Black | Stop Don't Talk To Me [HD] | Netflix", "description": "The cast of Orange Is The New Black sing their version of 'Don't Talk To Me' by Tre Coast ft.

Made entirely from never-before-seen, restored footage, it provides the most intimate and honest glimpse into the creative process and relationship between John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever filmed.  Be sure to check them both out, and don\u2019t forget to watch \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back\u201d when it rolls out over three days, November 25, 26, and 27, 2021, exclusively on Disney+.\n\nDirected by three-time Oscar\u00ae-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, \u201cThey Shall Not Grow Old\u201d), \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back\u201d takes audiences back in time to the band\u2019s January 1969 recording sessions, which became a pivotal moment in music history. The docuseries showcases The Beatles\u2019 creative process as they attempt to write 14 new songs in preparation for their first live concert in over two years. Faced with a nearly impossible deadline, the strong bonds of friendship shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr are put to the test. The docuseries is compiled from nearly 60 hours of unseen footage shot over 21 days, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and from more than 150 hours of unheard audio, most of which has been locked in a vault for over half a century. Jackson is the only person in 50 years to have been given access to this Beatles treasure trove, all of which has now been brilliantly restored.  What emerges is an unbelievably intimate portrait of The Beatles, showing how, with their backs against the wall, they could still rely on their friendship, good humor, and creative genius. While plans derail and relationships are put to the test, some of the world\u2019s most iconic songs are composed and performed. The docuseries features \u2013 for the first time in its entirety \u2013 The Beatles\u2019 last live performance as a group, the unforgettable rooftop concert on London\u2019s Savile Row, as well as other songs and classic compositions featured on the band\u2019s final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be.\n\nAn exciting new collaboration between The Beatles and Jackson presented by The Walt Disney Studios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd., \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back\u201d is directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison, Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen (\u201cThey Shall Not Grow Old\u201d) and Jonathan Clyde (\u201cEight Days a Week\u201d), with Apple Corps\u2019 Jeff Jones (\u201cEight Days a Week\u201d) and Ken Kamins (\u201cThe Hobbit\u201d trilogy) serving as executive producers. Jabez Olssen (\u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d) serves as the film\u2019s editor, the music supervisor is Giles Martin (\u201cRocketman\u201d), Michael Hedges (\u201cThe Adventures of Tintin\u201d) and Brent Burge (\u201cThe Hobbit\u201d trilogy) serve as the series re-recording mixers, and the music is mixed by Giles Martin and Sam Okell (\u201cYesterday\u201d).\n\nFollow The Beatles: Get Back | Disney+\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/disneyplus\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DisneyPlus/\nInstagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/disneyplus/", "channelTitle": "Walt Disney Studios", "channelId": "UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ", "tags": null, "viewCount": 61947, "likeCount": 1158, "commentCount": 95, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"], "sector": "Media"}, "bt1AgwQn-to": {"annots": ["Reciprocity", "Concreteness", "Social Identity"], "publishedAt": "2019-05-17T17:10:56Z", "title": "3M\u2122 Pro Grade Precision\u2122 Dust Channeling Sponge", "description": "ProGrade Channeling Sponge Built To Perform 30sec Video 2019, ProGrade, Channeling Sponge, Video", "channelTitle": "3M", "channelId": "UC6YDuKO3yui0tMpnM8dEKMg", "tags": ["Built To Perform", "Pro Grade Precison", "Channeling Sponge", "Abrasives", "ProContractor-PL"], "viewCount": 3788, "likeCount": 6, "commentCount": 0, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"], "sector": "Industrials"}, "DoeMCCchIEs": {"annots": ["Overcoming Reactance", "Foot in the Door", "Concreteness"], "publishedAt": "2019-05-08T10:57:32Z", "title": "Video Content Analysts | Cognizant Careers Portugal", "description": "Culture, atmosphere and a company\u2019s ambitions are also important factors when searching for an employer.

She befriends a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief, and together they are able to build a life for themselves on the London streets. One day, Estella\u2019s flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by two-time Oscar\u00ae winner Emma Thompson (\u201cHowards End,\u201d \u201cSense & Sensibility\u201d).

With interchangeable optics with autofocus, single-click multi-channel image-acquisition and an interface designed for usability, you can acquire publication quality images in minutes. And with a range of post-capture tools, from brightness/contrast, to annotations and automated cell counting the EVOS M5000 is an exceptionally versatile microscope and ideal for a broad range of imaging applications.\n\nThe EVOS M5000 Imaging System offers you these important advantages:\n\u2022  Easy installation; no maintenance, assembly, alignment, or calibration\n\u2022  User defined four-color fluorescence, transmitted light and color applications\n\u2022  Autofocus, Z-stack capability, time-lapse imaging and single-click multi-channel capture\n\u2022  On-board software for acquisition, analysis and automated cell counting\n\nFully integrated imaging system\nThe EVOS M5000 microscope combines and integrates precision components with a unique modern design functionality that enables high-quality fluorescence and color imaging anywhere with unprecedented flexibility. It is a fully integrated imaging system that combines precision optics, an 18.5\u201d high-resolution articulated LCD monitor, and a highly sensitive 3.2 MP monochrome CMOS camera (2048 x 1536) with 3.45 \u00b5m pixel resolution. The monochrome camera affords the best sensitivity for detection of faint fluorescence signals and allows quantitative analysis.  At the same time the condenser includes a novel LED-based RGB illumination scheme that enables high-quality, low-noise color image acquisition using the same monochrome sensor, enabling rendering of true color in transmitted light, e.g., imaging stained tissue samples such as H&E stained tissue sections.  \n\nVersatile and highly configurable\nWith a 5-position objective turret and the ability to acquire images in 4 fluorescence channels, transmitted light phase-contrast and color, the optical system can be easily configured to meet your needs.  Choose from our broad range of high quality long working distance and coverslip-corrected objectives [1] for use with plastic vessels or glass sides. Available from 1.25X to 100X magnification with achromat, fluorite, or apochromat correction, together with over twenty LED light cubes [2], the sample imaging options are limitless. Interchangeable vessel holders [3] accommodate most vessel types and sizes, including slides, multi-well plates, culture flasks, and Petri dishes, and afford precise control and sample alignment by the automated stage.  \n\nEasy to use and reliable\nThe EVOS M5000 Imaging System is powerful, yet offers the simplicity of plug-and-play. It requires no warm-up or cool-down periods, allowing you to capture images in minutes. The environmentally safe, mercury-free LED lights are rated for 50,000 hours and afford exceptional stability and durability\u2014you can turn the unit on and off whenever you need to image a sample. The long lifetime and low energy consumption translate into significantly lower operating costs compared to instruments with conventional light sources. Designed by biologists for biologists with a modern, icon-based interface, the EVOS M5000 microscope is remarkably easy to use. Following seamless image acquisition, you can analyze, edit and annotate your images using a set of convenient tools available in both live mode and for saved images. To easily count the number of DAPI-stained cells we have developed an automated cell count app. Once you have finished editing and analysis, save the images and data to the embedded hard-drive, an external USB device or a local network.\n\nThe EVOS imaging systems are built from the ground up to maximize performance and optimize workflow. You will be astonished at how easy it is to operate and amazed at how extraordinary your images look on-screen. \n\nhttps://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/cell-analysis/cellular-imaging/high-content-screening/high-content-screening-instruments/cellinsight-cx7-lzr.html?cid=BID_R01_PJT3746_COL16876_VI_YUT_OD_KT_722", "channelTitle": "Thermo Fisher Scientific", "channelId": "UCfUs2fCDhx07fkszsJ0jOcA", "tags": ["microscope", "fluorescence microscopy", "cell imaging", "cell culture", "cell analysis", "inverted microscope", "essen", "biotek", "bertin", "echo revolve", "incellis", "seiss", "leica", "Olympus", "Nikon"], "viewCount": 234844, "likeCount": 35, "commentCount": 2, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"], "sector": "Technology"}, "LUZl12jDtZk": {"annots": ["Authority", "Social Identity"], "publishedAt": "2013-07-08T14:22:06Z", "title": "Fastenal: We Are Where You Are", "description": "Fastenal We Are Where You Are :30 sec TV ad currently airing on the Sportsman Channel.", "channelTitle": "Fastenal", "channelId": "UC6ZcqbwWkuWDHcWnq26iK-Q", "tags": ["Fastenal", "TV", "Commercial", "30 second spot", "Industrial and Construction Supply", "We Are Where You Are", "Local Service", "Vending", "Technology", "Stores"], "viewCount": 4873, "likeCount": 13, "commentCount": 0, "topicCategories": [], "sector": "Wholesalers"}, "0_xgeOZrnJI": {"annots": ["Unclear"], "publishedAt": "2013-02-19T13:44:31Z", "title": "GeForce GTX TITAN Announcement", "description": "Get a first look of GeForce GTX TITAN, NVIDIA's new GPU.

Directed by Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) from a screenplay by William Wheeler (The Hoax) based on the book by Tim Crothers, Queen of Katwe is produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher (The Darjeeling Limited) and John Carls (Where the Wild Things Are) with Will Weiske and Troy Buder serving as executive producers. The film stars Golden Globe\u00ae nominee David Oyelowo (Selma), Oscar\u00ae winner and Tony Award\u00ae nominee Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) and newcomer Madina Nalwanga.\n\nFor 10-year-old Phiona Mutesi (Nalwanga) and her family, life in the impoverished slum of Katwe in Kampala, Uganda, is a constant struggle. Her mother, Harriet (Nyong'o), is fiercely determined to take care of her family and works tirelessly selling vegetables in the market to make sure her children are fed and have a roof over their heads. When Phiona meets Robert Katende (Oyelowo), a soccer player turned missionary who teaches local children chess, she is captivated. Chess requires a good deal of concentration, strategic thinking and risk taking, all skills which are applicable in everyday life, and Katende hopes to empower youth with the game. Phiona is impressed by the intelligence and wit the game requires and immediately shows potential. Recognizing Phiona's natural aptitude for chess and the fighting spirit she's inherited from her mother, Katende begins to mentor her, but Harriet is reluctant to provide any encouragement, not wanting to see her daughter disappointed. As Phiona begins to succeed in local chess competitions, Katende teaches her to read and write in order to pursue schooling. She quickly advances through the ranks in tournaments, but breaks away from her family to focus on her own life. Her mother eventually realizes that Phiona has a chance to excel and teams up with Katende to help her fulfill her extraordinary potential, escape a life of poverty and save her family. Disney's Queen of Katwe will open in U.S. theaters on September 23, 2016.\n\nLike Queen of Katwe on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/QueenOfKatwe/\n\nFollow Queen of Katwe on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/queenofkatwe\n\nFollow Queen of Katwe on Instagram:\nhttps://instagram.com/queenofkatwemovie", "channelTitle": "Walt Disney Studios", "channelId": "UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ", "tags": null, "viewCount": 28236, "likeCount": 89, "commentCount": 5, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"], "sector": "Media"}, "JFovlvhqJNA": {"annots": ["Authority", "Anthropomorphism", "Reciprocity", "Foot in the Door", "Scarcity", "Social Proof", "Concreteness", "Social Identity"], "publishedAt": "2020-07-30T13:48:56Z", "title": "S-76 Fleet Achieves 7.5 Million Flight Hours", "description": "Recently, the S-76 helicopter fleet surpassed 7.5 million hours of safe, reliable flight.

Eager to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother (Cate Blanchett) and her daughters Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) and Drisella (Sophie McShera) into the family home. But, when Ella's father unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother's dying words and to \"have courage and be kind.\" She will not give in to despair nor despise those who mistreat her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an apprentice at the Palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul.

For leftovers, remove all meat from the bones and store in fridge (up to 3 to 4 days) or freezer (up to 2 to 3 months). \n\nINGREDIENTS\n4 tsp kosher salt\n1/2 Tbs sugar\n1 Tbs dried thyme\n1 Tbs garlic powder\n1 1/2 tsp coarse-ground black pepper\n1 6-lb whole, bone-in turkey breast\n\nDIRECTIONS\n1. In a small bowl, combine spices. Set aside.\n\n2. Wash and pat dry turkey breast. Rub part of the spices between the turkey breast and skin. Remaining spices should be generously rubbed all over exterior of the breast. Place on a rimmed baking sheet, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 12 hours (up to 36 hours).\n\n3. Remove from refrigerator and let rest 30 minutes before roasting. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Place breast on a clean rimmed baking sheet.\n\n4. Roast turkey about 1 hour, or until internal temperature reaches 155\u00b0. Remove and let rest 15 minutes before serving.\n\nPRO TIPS\n1. Use your fingers to gently separate the membrane between the skin and the breast, while leaving the skin intact. Rubbing spices between the breast and skin will create juicy turkey and crisp skin. \n\n2. To store leftover turkey, remove all meat from the bone. Place in an airtight container. Turkey will keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days and in the freezer up to 2 to 3 months.\n\nRecipe here: http://bit.ly/2o3QpMx\n\nFor more, follow us and subscribe!\nYouTube:\u00a0https://www.youtube.com/user/albertsons \nPinterest:\u00a0https://www.pinterest.com/Albertsons/\nInstagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/albertsons/ \nTwitter:\u00a0https://twitter.com/albertsons \nFacebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Albertsons", "channelTitle": "Albertsons", "channelId": "UCikQkES0ipE52xJLQxLl6FQ", "tags": ["turkey", "simple", "dinner", "recipe"], "viewCount": 22650, "likeCount": 253, "commentCount": 0, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)"], "sector": "Food"}, "gu_oI-6jmMc": {"annots": ["Reciprocity", "Concreteness"], "publishedAt": "2015-11-06T18:23:01Z", "title": "Master of None | The Other Man: Wingman [HD] | Netflix", "description": "Every woman needs a good wingman.

Here\u2019s how:\n\n\u2022 Only iCGM that measures glucose every minute, meeting the highest level of accuracy standards.\u00b2 Every minute counts when it comes to managing diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre 2 system measures every minute, five times more often than other CGMs.\u00b3,\u2074\n\n\u2022 Longest lasting self-applied sensor. At 14 days, FreeStyle Libre 2 is the longest-lasting iCGM available, nearly 40 percent longer than the other iCGM. And with its built-in shutoff at 14 days, you can trust in its reliability. Simply, it\u2019s unsurpassed 14-day accuracy.\u00b9\n\n\u2022 Now for kids 4 and up. That\u2019s right. With U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance, FreeStyle Libre 2 can be prescribed for children 4 and older with diabetes once available, broadening the impact of this revolutionary technology.\n\n\u2022 A third of the cost. More features, excellent accuracy, significantly lower cost.\u2075 Compared to other CGMs, the FreeStyle Libre 2 system will cost 70% less.\n\n\u2022 Customizable, optional real-time alarms. You\u2019ll know within a minute when your glucose has veered too far from where it should be. Alarms automatically alert you if you\u2019re too high or too low without having to scan.\n\n\u2022 Fewer false alarms for kids 4 and up. The next generation of the FreeStyle Libre technology reduces false alarms for kids by a third compared with the other iCGM available\u2076 in the U.S.\n\nThe FreeStyle Libre 2 system, which will be available in the coming weeks, is another step toward resolving the inconveniences that can make it difficult for people to stick to a diabetes management plan. Users have the option of turning off alarms.\n\nFor the 34 million Americans living with diabetes, this FDA clearance of the latest version of FreeStyle Libre portfolio is another life-changing experience.\n\nGo play, kids. Rest easier, parents. Diabetes doesn't have to control you. FreeStyle Libre 2 will sound the alarm if there\u2019s anything to worry about. It's time to live.\n\nImportant safety info: http://www.Freestylelibre.us/safety-information\n\n\u00b9FreeStyle Libre 2 User Guide.\n\n\u00b2Based on FDA iCGM special controls.\n\n\u00b3Data on file. Abbott Diabetes Care.\n\n\u2074Dexcom G6 CGM User Guide.\n\n\u2075Based on a comparison of list prices of the FreeStyle Libre 14 day system versus competitors' CGM systems. FreeStyle Libre 2 system will be list priced the same rate as FreeStyle Libre 14 day system. The actual cost to patients may or may not be lower than other CGM systems, depending on the amount covered by insurance, if any.\n\n\u2076FreeStyle Libre 2 system user manual.

Directed by Spielberg, Disney\u2019s \u201cThe BFG\u201d tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie\u2019s presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist. Together, they come up with a plan to get rid of the giants once and for all. \n\nLike Disney's The BFG on Facebook:\nwww.facebook.com/thebfgmovie\n\nFollow Disney's The BFG on Twitter:\nwww.twitter.com/disneystudios\n\nFollow Disney's The BFG on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thebfgmovie", "channelTitle": "Walt Disney Studios", "channelId": "UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ", "tags": ["Disney", "The BFG", "Amblin Entertainment", "Mark Rylance", "Steven Spielberg", "Jemaine Clement", "Ruby Barnhill", "Bill Hader"], "viewCount": 269308, "likeCount": 979, "commentCount": 39, "topicCategories": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film"], "sector": "Media"}, "MJGkm0UwNRk": {"annots": ["Social Identity"], "publishedAt": "2017-12-19T16:30:01Z", "title": "Narcos - Season 4 | Teaser [HD] I Netflix", "description": "The new season of Narcos coming 2018.\n\nWatch Narcos on Netflix: www.netflix.com/title/80025172\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/29qBUt7\n\nAbout Netflix:\nNetflix is the world's leading internet entertainment service with 130 million memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages.

Luckily, this video gives you step-by-step directions on how to identify the parts of the meat, heat the grill and cook your local Colorado steak to the perfect doneness!\n\nINGREDIENTS\n1 T-Bone Beef Steak, cut 1 \u00bd inches thick\n2 tsp vegetable oil\n2 tsp kosher salt\n1 coarsely ground black pepper\n\nDIRECTIONS\n1. Preheat grill to 500 to 600\u00ba, lighting only one side of the grill. Rub steak with oil, salt and pepper. Let rest on counter to bring to room temperature for about 30 minutes.\n\n2. Place steak on the cool side the grill, being sure to place the short side of the steak away from the heated side of grill for about 15-20 minutes. Once the large side of the steak reaches an internal temperature of 115\u00ba (110\u00ba for the short side) move and sear the steak on the hot side of the grill, about 2-3 minutes per side, or until an internal temperature of 130\u00ba is reached for medium-rare.\n\n3.
